1 - Review the starter code shown below. Your task is to complete the function at the bottom of the code so that it emulates the given formula.

2 - Review and refine your existing plan to allocate the work among your team members. For example, you might decide that one student will write the first draft of the algorithm, another will check it and write tests, and the third can implement the algorithm in Python. 

3 - Draw up your testing plans (your test cases and method for obtaining expected outputs). You may use Sheets like in Exercise 3, use other software instead, or do it by hand. 

4 - Write an algorithm to solve the problem and create either pseudocode or a flowchart to represent it.

5 - Complete the program so that the function produces the correct output using the given parameters. Do not change the function name or parameters, or any of the other functions in the code. It is OK if you want to add additional functions, such as functions that help automate your testing processes. You can do this work directly in the Snippet, or you can use another IDE of you want.

6 - Test your code and document the test results. Your documented tests (in your report) should include at least 2 cases that aren't already in the grader's test_z_score_function() in the starter code.

7 - Adjust the script as needed until the tests produce the expected output.

8 - Include a list of group members who participated in the work in the function comment provided for that purpose.
